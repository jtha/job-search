### Professional Summary
I am a Senior Supply Chan & Analytics expert with 9 years of experience turning complex datasets into actionable insights that drive strategic business decisions. My passion lies in using tools like SQL, Python, and Metabase to build automated reports, create predictive models, and uncover the 'why' behind the numbers.

I specialize in applying this analytical toolkit to solve real-world challenges in supply chain, logistics, and eCommerce operations. I have a proven track record of leveraging data and automation to achieve over 95% product availability while reducing Days of Inventory from 75 to 30 and cutting product waste from 20% to under 3%. By bridging the gap between raw data and operational execution, I help organizations become more efficient, predictive, and profitable.
