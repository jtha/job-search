# Work Experience Summary

## Methodology Explanation

Issue Detected

The summary lacks details about the user's specific responsibilities, tools, strategies, or skills used in the role.

Why This Is Important

Highlighting the specific approaches you've taken showcases your domain knowledge and expertise, which is crucial for recruiters to understand your capabilities and fit for the role.

How to Improve

Detail the methods or technologies you used and their impact on the project outcomes. For example, if you improved website traffic, instead of saying "increased website traffic," say "Applied SEO and content marketing strategies, boosting website traffic by 40%." This not only specifies your approach but also quantifies the result, making your contribution clear.



# Work Experience bullet points

## Use of Filler words

Why This Is Important

Brevity is key in resumes. Filler words and unnecessary adverbs take up space without adding value, making your accomplishments less impactful.

How to Improve

Eliminate the identified fillers and focus on specific, quantifiable achievements.

## Lack of Accomplishment

Issue Detected

The bullet point lacks a clear result or impact of the troubleshooting and improvements.
Why This Is Important

Recruiters are looking for clear evidence of impact through accomplishments. Quantifiable metrics or milestones speak directly to your contribution.
How to Improve

Think about the outcomes of your work. Did you increase efficiency, reduce costs, or improve customer satisfaction? Quantify these achievements (e.g., "Increased sales by 20%") or clearly state milestones (e.g., "Launched a new product line that became the market leader within a year").

## Lack of Action Verbs

Issue Detected

The bullet point does not start with a verb in the past tense.
Why This Is Important

Hiring managers look for impact on your resume, and strong action verbs show them you accomplished something at your past jobs, you werenâ€™t just "responsible for" it.
How to Improve

Detail the methods or technologies you used and their impact on the project outcomes. For example, if you improved website traffic, instead of saying "increased website traffic," say "Applied SEO and content marketing strategies, boosting website traffic by 40%." This not only specifies your approach but also quantifies the result, making your contribution clear.
