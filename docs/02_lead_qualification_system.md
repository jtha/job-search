## Assessment Pipeline

### Phase 1: Job Description Deconstruction

The system breaks down job postings into analyzable components through a multi-step process:

#### Step 1: Initial Tagging (`ja_2_1_jobdesc_tagging`)
```python
# Extract and categorize job requirements
response_schema_2_1 = Schema(
    type=Type.OBJECT,
    required=["tagged_list"],
    properties={
        "tagged_list": Schema(
            type=Type.ARRAY,
            items=Schema(
                type=Type.OBJECT,
                required=["2A_raw_string", "2B_category"],
                properties={
                    "2A_raw_string": Schema(type=Type.STRING),
                    "2B_category": Schema(
                        type=Type.STRING,
                        enum=["required", "additional"]
                    )
                }
            )
        )
    }
)
```

**Purpose**: Extracts and initially categorizes requirements from job descriptions into "required" or "additional" qualifications.

#### Step 2: Requirement Atomization (`ja_2_2_jobdesc_atomizing`)
```python
# Break down compound requirements into atomic units
response_schema_2_2 = Schema(
    type=Type.OBJECT,
    required=["atomic_objects"],
    properties={
        "atomic_objects": Schema(
            type=Type.ARRAY,
            items=Schema(
                type=Type.OBJECT,
                required=["2A_atomic_string", "2B_category"],
                properties={
                    "2A_atomic_string": Schema(type=Type.STRING),
                    "2B_category": Schema(
                        type=Type.STRING,
                        enum=["required", "additional"]
                    )
                }
            )
        )
    }
)
```

**Purpose**: Decomposes complex, compound requirements into individual, assessable skills or qualifications.

#### Step 3: Final Classification (`ja_2_3_jobdesc_final`)
```python
# Classify each atomic requirement
response_schema_2_3 = Schema(
    type=Type.OBJECT,
    required=["classification"],
    properties={
        "classification": Schema(
            type=Type.STRING,
            enum=["required_qualification", "additional_qualification", "evaluated_qualification"]
        )
    }
)
```

**Purpose**: Determines if each atomic requirement is:
- **Required Qualification**: Verifiable from resume
- **Additional Qualification**: Preferred but not mandatory
- **Evaluated Qualification**: Soft skills assessed during interviews

### Phase 2: Resume-Job Matching

#### Individual Requirement Assessment (`ja_3_1_assessment`)
```python
# Assess each requirement against candidate profile
response_schema_3_1 = Schema(
    type=Type.OBJECT,
    required=["3A_match_reasoning", "3B_match"],
    properties={
        "3A_match_reasoning": Schema(type=Type.STRING),
        "3B_match": Schema(type=Type.BOOLEAN)
    }
)
```

**Matching Logic**:
- **Conservative Approach**: Matches only confirmed by explicit resume evidence
- **Evidence-Based**: Requires direct keyword or experience alignment
- **Reasoning Required**: Every decision includes detailed justification

## Assessment Criteria

### Match Determination Standards

#### ✓ Match Criteria
1. **Years of Experience**: Candidate's domain experience meets or exceeds requirement
2. **Specific Skills/Tools**: Exact tool or direct equivalent found in resume
3. **Conceptual Skills**: Methodology or concept explicitly mentioned
4. **Education Level**: Degree level meets minimum requirements
5. **"Similar" Clauses**: Any relevant tool from category matches broad requirements

#### ✗ No Match Criteria
1. **Missing Keywords**: Required skill/tool not found in resume
2. **Insufficient Experience**: Years of experience below threshold
3. **Degree Field Mismatch**: Education in unrelated field
4. **Partial Compound Requirements**: Missing any component of multi-part requirement

### Rating System [To Be Confirmed]

The system generates three-tier ratings based on required qualification matches:

```python
# Rating calculation logic
match_percentage = required_qualifications_matched_count / total_required_qualifications

if match_percentage > 0.8:
    rating = "high"
elif match_percentage >= 0.5:
    rating = "medium"
else:
    rating = "low"
```

#### Rating Descriptions
- **High (>80%)**: "Your profile seems to match well with this job. You may be ready to apply."
- **Medium (50-80%)**: "Your profile matches several required qualifications. Consider updating your profile or exploring better matches."
- **Low (<50%)**: "Your profile is missing some required qualifications. Look for jobs with stronger matches."

## Technical Implementation

### Concurrent Processing Architecture

```python
async def generate_job_assessment(limit: int = 100, days_back: int = 14, semaphore_count: int = 5):
    # Create semaphore for controlling concurrency
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(semaphore_count)
    
    # Create tasks for concurrent processing
    tasks = [
        process_single_job_assessment(
            job=job,
            resume=resume,
            prompt_configuration_2_1=prompt_configuration_2_1,
            prompt_configuration_2_2=prompt_configuration_2_2,
            prompt_configuration_2_3=prompt_configuration_2_3,
            prompt_configuration_3_1=prompt_configuration_3_1,
            semaphore=semaphore
        )
        for job in job_details
    ]
    
    # Execute all tasks concurrently with semaphore control
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

### Token Usage Monitoring

The system tracks detailed token consumption across all AI operations:

```python
token_details_by_model = {}
# Track token usage for each model
model_name = result['tokens']['model']
if model_name not in token_details_by_model:
    token_details_by_model[model_name] = {'input': 0, 'output': 0, 'thinking': 0}
token_details_by_model[model_name]['input'] += result['tokens']['input_tokens']
token_details_by_model[model_name]['output'] += result['tokens']['output_tokens']
token_details_by_model[model_name]['thinking'] += result['tokens']['thinking_tokens']
```

### Error Handling and Quarantine System

Failed assessments are tracked in a quarantine system for later retry:

```python
# Quarantine failed jobs with specific error codes
await upsert_job_quarantine(
    job_quarantine_id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
    job_id=job['job_id'],
    job_quarantine_reason="failed_generate_jobdesc_tagging",
    job_quarantine_timestamp=int(time.time())
)
```

**Quarantine Reasons**:
- `failed_generate_jobdesc_tagging`: Error in initial requirement extraction
- `failed_generate_jobdesc_atomizing`: Error in requirement decomposition
- `failed_generate_jobdesc_final`: Error in final classification
- `failed_generate_assessment`: Error in match evaluation
