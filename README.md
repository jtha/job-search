# job-search

## About the Project
The motivation to build this project is to help a job seeker (me) retain their sanity while searching for a job in 2025. Based on many horror stories including personal experiences where job seekers may have to apply to hundreds and even thousands of job postings to land an interview, this project aims to streamline the job search process by maximizing volume and quality of job applications.

Project scope:
1. Build a lead generation system to find job postings.
2. Build a lead scoring and qualification system to filter job postings.
3. Build a content generation system to generate cover letters and resumes.
4. Build a dashboard to track job applications.
